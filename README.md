## Modelo de clasificación para predecir sobrevivencia después de un año de un ataque cardíaco
### Grupo 2 - Luis Florian & Rene Tarot

#### Data Set Information:
All the patients suffered heart attacks at some point in the past. Some are still alive and some are not. The survival and still-alive variables, when taken together, indicate whether a patient survived for at least one year following the heart attack.
The problem addressed by past researchers was to predict from the other variables whether or not the patient will survive at least one year. The most difficult part of this problem is correctly predicting that the patient will NOT survive. (Part of the difficulty seems to be the size of the data set.)
